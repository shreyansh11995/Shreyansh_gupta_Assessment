  This Program is written in C++ , to identify the longest and second longest compound words.
  I used a well defined functions and efficient data structures.The 'readWords' function reads words from a file into vector.'checkCompoundWord' is defined to determine if the word is compound using a recursive approach with memoization.
  The 'LongestCompoundWords' function sort these words to get longest compound words.The 'result' function is where all the functions are called ,used '<chrono>' for precise timing.
